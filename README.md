â˜• Coffee Sales â€“ Power BI Dashboards

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
I analyzed coffee sales data from Kaggle using Power BI, building two dashboards: one focused on revenue, the other on orders.

ðŸ›  Tools & Skills
- Power BI Desktop  
- Power Query (data cleaning & transformation)  
- DAX (measures & KPIs)  
- Dashboard layout & design  

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Sales transactions (coffee type, order time, revenue, quantity).  
- Multiple dimensions including product type, time of order, and revenue per transaction.  

ðŸ”‘ Process
- Cleaned & transformed dataset (renamed, changed data types, merged/split columns).  
- Created KPIs using DAX (Total Revenue, Avg Orders, % Revenue by Category).  
- Designed dashboards using cards, bar charts, pies, and matrices.  

ðŸ“Š Key Insights â€“ Revenue
- â‚¦112.25K revenue from 3,547 orders.  
- April had highest sales, with another spike in October.  
- Morning contributed 32% of total revenue.  
- Latte was top performer, Espresso the lowest.  

ðŸ“Š Key Insights â€“ Orders
- Order volume peaked in April and October.  
- Morning had most orders (1.18K).  
- Americano with milk was most ordered coffee.  

âœ¨ Reflection
I went from complete beginner to building clean Power BI dashboards in just a couple of days. This project proved to me that consistency and practice can speed up learning dramatically.
